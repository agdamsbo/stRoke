# A toolbox

My own toolbox in my small workshop is a mix of some old, worn, well proven tools and some newcomers. This package should be seen as something like that.

I have tried to collect tools and functions from other packages that I use regularly in addition to functions that I have written myself to fill use cases, that I have not been able to find solutions to elsewhere.
